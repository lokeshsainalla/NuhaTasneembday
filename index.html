<h3 id="lokesh">Dear mental,</h3>
<p >
Thanks for allowing me into your life. 
You are the one who changed me, you are the one who made me laugh. You are the only one who has transformed me. You have always motivated me and encouraged me thanks for that too. You with your funny words made me laugh out from the bottom of my heart. The moment you entered my life, my life has changed. Every day was a special day with you and every second with you was a beautiful one. Time went so fast chatting with you. There were no bounds to my happiness from the time you entered my life. The way you treated me was awesome. The fun we had together is never forgettable. All the funny conversations we had, all the silly doubts I ask, all the hilarious answers you give are always remembered madam. The quarrels we had, the apologies after them were the funniest of all. Of course your childhood incidents, your experiences (good or bad) and your sweet memories with your friends are lovely. For me it's like a heaven staying with you. I treat it as an honor to receive a great person like you as my bestie. Thanks for sharing your love, affection, caring and time. Thanks for introducing PK and Srita two lovely sisters into my life. Thanks is a very small word for all those beautiful gifts. Hats off for listening to all those boring stuff which I have told you. For me this small piece of writing is a token of love. I just know you are the person with a golden heart. I don’t even want you to change for anything and for anyone. I don't know whether I will bring a smile on your face or not but I really want a smile on your face forever and ever. Of course I will always be there with you. Please never leave your P........ Yedava all alone. Let’s definitely meet in the future wherever we are on this earth. I will be waiting for your "YES".
